# Simple-HTN-Planner
PyHOP is a simple hierarchical task network (HTN) planner written in Python; here is a trivial port of PyHop 2.0 in Visual Studio (2019) C++.

[PyHop 2.0 Github repo](https://github.com/oubiwann/pyhop)

C++ code only runs the travel example from PyHop; other examples will follow.

Currently, planner and (travel) example are in one file (main.cpp); later commits will split planner and examples.
